`bos-workspace` is a comprehensive toolset designed to simplify the development and deployment of [NEAR components](https://docs.near.org/bos/tutorial/quickstart) and applications. With support for hot reload, TypeScript, and multiple app management, it caters to developers looking for an efficient and scalable development environment.

## Quickstart

### Installation

You can install `bos-workspace` globally on your machine or within your existing project workspace using npm (or other package manager):

```cmd
npm install bos-workspace
```

### Usage

To start, you may clone an existing project via:

```bash
bos-workspace clone [accountId]
```

or build your workspace from scratch. 

`bos-workspace` supports both multi and single app development because of this core concept:
  
* **Apps**: which belong to an Account, described by a `bos.config.json`. A structure may look like this:

```txt
app.near/
â”œâ”€â”€ widget/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ example.jsx
â””â”€â”€ bos.config.json
```

where the content of `bos.config.json` is:

```json
{
  "account": "app.near"
}
```

* **Workspace**: may hold multiple apps, described by a `bos.workspace.json`

```txt
apps/
â”œâ”€â”€ app1.near/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ widget/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ example.jsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bos.config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ app2.near/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ widget/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ example.jsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bos.config.json
bos.workspace.json
```

where the content of `bos.workspace.json` is:

```json
{
  "apps": ["/apps/*"]
}
```

**Note:** The "app name" is not required to end in `.near`, and apps don't necessarily have to be stored in a directory named `/apps`. What's important is that the `bos.config.json` is located at the same level as directories such as `/widget`, and that `bos.workspace.json` specifies the directory it resides in.
